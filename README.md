# Zero Day Exploits & Scripts - By S-havl

🔓 **Unlocking the Secrets of Cybersecurity**  
Welcome to the dark corner of the internet where Python meets penetration testing, vulnerability exploits, and malicious-but-ethical code. Here, I share the tools I've created to hack my way through learning ethical hacking, focusing on **Red Team** tactics and security automation.

## 🛠️ **My Tools**  
I live in the terminal.  
I thrive on **Python**.  
My goal? Write code that **breaks** and **fixes**. Here’s a glimpse of what I’m working on:

### **Keylogger (For Educational Purposes)**
- A Python script that records keystrokes. It’s not malicious, it’s educational (and an essential part of learning how attacks work).

### **Password Strength Checker**
- This script tells you if your password is secure or not (hint: it’s probably not).

### **Scanner & Exploits**
- Vulnerability scanners, exploits for testing systems, and a bunch of other fun stuff to help you understand where security gaps exist.

## 💻 **The Tools I Use**
- **Python**: The perfect language for hacking. Simple, powerful, and flexible for security scripts.
- **Linux**: My playground for testing vulnerabilities and running security tools.  
- **GitHub**: Version control for all my code and hacking projects.

## 📜 **Learning & Hacking**
This repo is a record of my journey in ethical hacking. I’m constantly testing, breaking, and improving these scripts to learn more about how systems can be secured, or compromised, in a safe environment.

## 💥 **Want to Collaborate?**
I’m always open to collaboration and feedback. If you see something wrong (or something you can improve), open a pull request. Let’s make these tools better, together.

## ⚠️ **Warning**  
These scripts are for educational purposes only. I do not condone illegal hacking, and all tools should only be used in **authorized environments**.
